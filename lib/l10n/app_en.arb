"beefsteakdetails":"Take the steaks out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to allow them to come to room temperature. This ensures more even cooking.Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.Season both sides generously with salt and black pepper. You can also add additional herbs or spices for flavor.Heat a heavy skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and allow it to heat until shimmering.Place the steaks in the hot pan and sear for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or adjust the time for your preferred level of doneness.Add butter to the pan during the last minute of cooking. Optionally, add minced garlic and fresh herbs to enhance the flavor.Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter. This adds richness and flavor.Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. For medium-rare, it should be around 135°F (57°C).Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the steak juicy.Slice the steaks against the grain into 1/2-inch slices.Optionally, drizzle with Worcestershire sauce or balsamic glaze before serving.Serve your classic beef steaks with your favorite side dishes, such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a crisp salad.Feel free to customize the seasoning and add your favorite sauces or marinades to make it your own.
